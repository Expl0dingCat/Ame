# Interfaces
Interfaces are ways to interact with Ame. Currently, there are 2 interfaces, a client + server and a telegram bot.

## Server/client
The server hosts a simple local server, that by default broadcasts on 127.0.0.1:5440, use a reverse proxy to get a public URL. This is not designed for production use.

Server.py MUST be in the root folder in order to import controller. This folder only exists for organization/storage purposes.

## Telegram
Not implemented yet.
